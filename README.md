# Seinfeld-Script-Generator-RNN
 TV Script Generation using an LSTM RNN.
In this project, I'll generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network I'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
 
 ## Training Data
 
 The data is in **./data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt**
